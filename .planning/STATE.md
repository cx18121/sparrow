# Project State

## Source Of Truth

Use these docs for current behavior:

- `CONTEXT.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/adr/`
- `.planning/PROJECT.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

Older files under `.planning/research/`, `.planning/phases/`, and `.scratch/` are historical unless a current doc explicitly points at them.

## Current Product

Sparrow is campaign-first. Global navigation is Home, Templates, Settings. Campaign work lives under `/campaigns/:id/*` with Overview, Leads, Drafts, Sent, and Settings.

## Current Architecture

- Frontend: Vite + React + Tailwind.
- API: Vercel Functions-compatible router, with `local-api.ts` for local Express development.
- Database: Supabase Postgres via Prisma 7.
- Auth: Supabase Auth.
- Gmail: Google OAuth + Gmail API.
- AI: host-managed Anthropic Claude key.
- Research: Exa-first, Tavily fallback.
- Contacts: Apollo search/reveal.

## Current Decisions

- No per-user Claude or Apollo keys in the product.
- Settings has three tabs: Profile, Sending, Account.
- Templates default to verbatim mode.
- Headcount filter is retired from the audience UI.
- `LeadStatus` is SAVED, EMAILED, NO_RESPONSE, DECLINED.
- Reply detection, scheduled sends, and follow-up automation are deferred.

## Active Concerns

- Accessibility hardening: labels and modal focus management.
- Bundle size around vendor/pdf/docx parser chunks.
- Research dossier freshness is manual/implicit, not a scheduled refresh.
- Some old planning files are archived and intentionally not reliable as current implementation docs.

## Last Manual Refresh

2026-05-05: Root context, ADRs, README, product/design docs, env example, and active planning docs updated to match current implementation.
